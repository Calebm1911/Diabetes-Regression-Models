# Diabetes-Regression-Models

The script applies the following regression models:

Linear Regression
RANSAC with Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
# Data Preparation
The Diabetes dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets. Features are standardized, and polynomial features are generated for certain models.

# Model Training and Evaluation
Each regression model is trained using the training set, and R2 scores are calculated for both the training and testing sets to assess performance.

# Results
The script outputs R2 scores for each regression model on both the training and testing sets.
